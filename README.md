This is a webpage that fetches satellite maps of locations from Houston crime reports. It was created during the Houston Data Visualization December Data Jam.

The data provided during the data jam only had address ranges, so images are created around markers representing the first and last addresses in the ranges.

The actual code is in src/App.js
